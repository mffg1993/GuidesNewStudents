> Are you new in the lab? Not sure where to start with data analysis in the optics lab?  
> **I’ve been there.** So I tried to give you some answers!

This is a student-friendly, optics-skewed Python toolbox designed to help you go from "what am I even looking at?" to "I think this plot is actually publishable."

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

This repository contains a series of interactive, beginner-focused Jupyter notebooks to help you:

- Understand the theory behind common lab techniques  
- Apply those techniques in real experimental workflows  
- Learn by doing (with code, plots, and physical insight)

Each topic is designed to be approachable, practical, and written with undergrads in mind.

### 🧰 Topics Covered

- 📉 **Curve Fitting**  
  Linear, polynomial, and custom model fitting using `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`.

- 🧮 **Error Analysis**  
  Standard deviation, propagation of uncertainty, and weighted fitting — the essentials of making your numbers mean something.

- 🎧 **Signal Processing**  
  Learn to clean up and interpret signals using FFTs, smoothing, and filters (Butterworth, Gaussian, etc.).

- 📊 **Plotting**  
  Turn raw data into readable, styled plots with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

- 🔬 **Image Processing** *(coming soon)*  
  Learn to extract useful information from images — beam profiles, interference patterns, and more.

## 🧪 Why This Exists

You're handed some data and told to *analyze it*.  
Now what?

These notebooks aim to answer that question. They’re meant to be your digital lab partner — friendly, thorough, and always ready to explain what a residual is.

This resource is perfect for:
- Physics & engineering undergrads
- Teaching assistants and lab instructors
- Curious students and early researchers
