# ðŸ§ª Python Lab Tutorials for Undergraduate Physics

Welcome to the **Python Lab Tutorials** repository! This collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks is designed to introduce undergraduate studentsâ€”especially those in physics, optics, or engineeringâ€”to foundational programming tools that are useful in laboratory environments.

## ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Learn

Each tutorial covers essential topics in scientific computing, with examples tailored for optics and experimental physics. The goal is to build up practical skills while reinforcing theoretical knowledge through hands-on coding.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- **Curve Fitting**: Linear, polynomial, and custom model fitting with `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`.
- **Error Analysis**: Standard deviation, propagation of uncertainty, and weighted fitting.
- **Signal Processing**: Fourier transforms, filtering, smoothing.
- **Plotting**: Heatmaps, bar plots, scatter plots, styling with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Image Processing** *(coming soon)*: Handling and analyzing experimental images.
